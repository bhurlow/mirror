- ditch 'Page' class in favor of composable rendering functions
- package into cli for certain use cases 
- where to fetch from db?
	- not trying to solve the data problem 
	- but basic SQL page rendering would be helpful
- prod advanced compilation mode with no moving parts
- wrapping for the google closure stuff that's useful but esoteric (e.g. XHR, url parsing, module loading etc)
- strategy for browser repl?
- sync client and server side state, use for re-rendering
- detect offline in client and store changes in batch 
- render stacktraces 
- watch cljs for changes rather compile each time
